    <h1>Welcome to Laundry Wallah / Laundry Mart.</h1>
    </header>
    <p>We have the full portfolio of laundry services in Pune – be it laundry for daily home wear, office clothes or even for your woollen clothes, we can take care of it all. (Only washable woollen clothes are processed under woollen laundry service in Pune. Dry Clean only clothes can’t be processed under woollen laundry).</p>

    <p>We wash each customer’s clothes separately. Our focus on hygiene is the biggest reason our laundry services are trusted by 30 Lac+ customers. Moreover, we follow all the Covid safety guidelines prescribed by WHO & CDC. As a precautionary measure, we also use medical grade disinfectants to sanitize each washing load.

We also offer 100% color bleed protection in our washing process. All clothes are tested for color bleed before putting in machine. Any potential color bleed clothes are washed separately using mild detergents.

We also have a proprietary Whitex technology for making your white clothes (like shirts, kurtas and pyjamas) 3 shades brighter. Combine it with our Italian steam ironing and intelligent packing, and you get a crisp and impeccable finish every time with our laundry service.</p>
